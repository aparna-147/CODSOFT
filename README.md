Achieve high accuracy in spam detection


‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run:

1. Open the folder: Spam SMS Detection


2. Launch spam_sms_detection.ipynb


3. Run all cells in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab


4. Observe predictions and accuracy reports
   
‚úÖ Requirements

1. Python installed (v3.7 or above)

2. Jupyter Notebook or any code editor (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)

3. Required libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn (install using pip)

4. Dataset (if applicable) in .csv format

üí° Tips

1. Always check for null/missing values before model training

2. Use comments to explain key logic in code

3. Start with simple models before applying complex ones

4. Save models using joblib or pickle for reuse

5. Regularly visualize data for better insights
